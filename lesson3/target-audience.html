            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The target audience of this site will consist of the community members from the Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven areas. These community members are mostly senior couples, and young families. 
                    <br><br>
                    The senior couples are set in their ways and most likely grew up farming in the area. They don't have a lot of experience with technology and will need all the help they can get.
                    <br><br>
                    The younger families are new to the area. They don't know a lot about the weather in Idaho, but are interested to learn about their new town and what they can expect when it comes to weather.
